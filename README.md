# spikequant
Remove and Quantify Organism Spike Reads from Sequencing Data

## Prerequisites

Must have snakemake available in `PATH`.

### dependencies
Either execute snakemake with `--use-singularity` (or the updated syntax for snakemake 8), a snakemake profile with singularity configured, or from a conda environment with the following dependencies precent:

- pigz
- ART read simulator


## Structure
Repo has been structured according to Snakemake's best practices. There are two supplementary workflows outside of this structure, to keep them from being imported when using tools like snakedeploy.  these are a benchmarking workflow and a test data generating workflow



## Test Data
Test data can be generated by running the following:
```
snakemake --snakefile testdata/Snakefile --directory $PWD/testdata/data/
```
